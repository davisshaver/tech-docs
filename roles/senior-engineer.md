# Senior Engineer

Our Senior Engineers have two focuses: mentorship, and doing whatever needed to level-up our products. If we do things right, these two will often intersect. And, if we do things right, we’ll be proactive about minimizing the pain that comes from scaling both.

Responsibilities:
- Define our application architecture, and when we build in-house vs. choosing a vendor
- Provide leadership when the team runs into tough technical problems.
- Be a key catalyst to helping us ship fast and often.
- Mentor engineering team through training, code review, and career path development.
- Manage integrations with external vendors.
- Build and maintain tools for Editorial, Sales, Social Media, and Audience Development
- Manage online advertising systems, including ad server integrations, HTML email development, and ad tracking systems.
- Propose solutions for problems editorial and business don’t even know they have.
- Over-communicate, knowing communication is the oxygen of a distributed team.
- Take ownership of, and have a sense of pride in, every Fusion product you touch.

Qualifications:
- Proven ability to ship great features that will make Fusion a world-class media brand.
- 4+ years experience doing what you love — full-stack development.
- Experience with managing a team of engineers, code review, mentoring, and shipping awesome products
- Experience with full product lifecycles, rapid prototyping and iterative product development
- Understanding of distributed, scalable web application architecture
- Detailed knowledge of application development, performance, and responsive web design
- A firm understanding of web analytics systems (Omniture, Google Analytics, etc...)
- A positive, constructive and collaborative attitude that inspires others to produce their best work
- Open source contributions a plus.
