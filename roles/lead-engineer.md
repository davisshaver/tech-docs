Fusion's Lead Engineers have two focuses: mentoring engineers on their team, and ensuring their team delivers the best possible product. Candidates should be innovative, self-motivated, and interested in applying modern development techniques. They should also be strong multi-taskers with exceptional time-management skills. 

The Lead Engineer works in tandem with product to design ground-breaking applications. You will help grow a strong, innovative, engineering team, working with cutting-edge technologies.

- Advanced JavaScript knowledge, independent of third-party libraries
- Knowledge of JavaScript design patterns and potential issues when creating shared, portable code.
- Strong experience with service-oriented architectures.
- Ability to consider and judge multiple approaches to a given business problem.
- Define our application architecture, and when we build in-house vs. choosing a vendor.
- Manage online advertising systems, including ad server integrations, HTML email development, and ad tracking systems.
- Propose solutions for problems editorial and business don’t even know they have.
- Over-communicate, knowing communication is the oxygen of a distributed team.
- Take ownership of, and have a sense of pride in, every Fusion product you touch.

Qualifications:
- Opinions about client-side JavaScript frameworks (React/Flux, Angular, Backbone, Ember, etc.)
- Real-world experience creating simple to complex web apps with Node or Python.
- Ability to automate local dev and deployment with Gulp or Grunt.
- Aptitude for deciding what data we should track with Google Analytics, and how we should query for it.
- Experience deploying and maintaining ad Serving solutions like DoubleClick for Publishers (DFP) / DART.
- Enthusiasm for leading a team of engineers, and shipping awesome products through code review and mentorship.
- Bias towards rapid prototyping and iterative product development.
- 4+ years experience doing what you love — full-stack development.
- A positive, constructive and collaborative attitude that inspires others to produce their best work.
- Open source contributions a huge plus.
