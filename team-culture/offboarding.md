# Offboarding

Although you are not required under Fusion's at-will policy, if you plan to leave the team, we ask that you inform your manager, or an HR representative, as soon as possible so that your offboarding can be planned.

### Giving notice

Schedule a one-on-one with your manager to discuss the situation and inform them of your intent to leave. Your manager will give you guidance on how and when your departure should be shared with the team.

If you are providing your manager or HR with advance notice, then the last day can probably be scheduled based on your current projects and calendar needs. Your HR representative will assist with this scheduling process. Don't worry about unused vacation or personal days – they will be included in your final paycheck. 

### Exit interview

Your HR representative will ask if you'd participate in an exit interview. These take no more than 30 minutes, and HR uses the feedback to improve its own process, as well as providing qualified feedback to your manager and other company leadership. 

### Equipment return
Your HR representative will send you a FedEx label via email. You can take that label, along with your equipment, to FedEx, and they'll help you pack & ship any hardware that may have been provided.

### Your last day
By the end of your last day, you should have done the following things:
- [ ] Documented on Trello and Github the current status of any work currently assigned to you.
- [ ] Returned your equipment to Fusion HQ.
- [ ] Removed yourself from the `fusioneng` Github organization (don't worry, you'll still be able to see this repo).
- [ ] Published a goodbye post on O2 – let us know what you're doing next, share contact information, a farewell GIF.

### The final act
Your last responsibility: Email your HR representative requesting that they deactivate your Google Apps account.
