# Onboarding

Starting a new job can be overwhelming. We want to make your first days, weeks, and months at Fusion as predictable, productive, and stress-free as possible.

[Before you start](#before-you-start) | [Your first day](#your-first-day) | [Your first week](#your-first-week) | [Your first month](#your-first-month)

## Before you start

You've gone through our [hiring process](https://github.com/fusioneng/tech-docs/blob/master/team-culture/how-we-hire.md), we've made you a sweet job offer that you're excited to accept, and we've agreed on a start date. Congratulations! We’re excited to work with you.

We'll work through the standard hiring paperwork with you and figure out your equipment needs so that you'll be ready to go on day one.

### Paperwork: Benefits, Payroll, Tax Forms, etc.

HR will be in close contact to get your paperwork in order for taxes, direct deposit, benefits enrollment, etc. Fusion’s benefits package includes medical, dental, vision, and life insurance as well as a 401k retirement savings plan.

A representative(s) from HR will guide you through the process of benefits enrollment. Be sure to ask questions if something doesn't make sense.

Within three days of your official start, you’ll need to fill out I-9 paperwork. This must be done in-person at a local Fusion, Univision, or ABC office, or the documents must be notarized. Make sure this is on your radar, and that you bring the appropriate paperwork.
 
### Equipment

We believe in providing the hardware and software you need to get your job done. We will ask you to choose from a selection of computers, and we'll take a list of additional equipment and software from you. Our goal is to provide everything you ask for by your first day. Just use common sense and keep it reasonable. An external display for your MacBook Pro: reasonable. A brand new Apple Watch: probably not.

Hardware and software requests in addition to the basics (computer and peripherals, software needed for your daily work) will need to go through an approval process. We will do our best to get you everything you ask for, and to communicate clearly with you in instances where we can't fulfill a request.

## Your first day

You're excited, maybe a little nervous and not sure exactly where to start. No worries! We'll make sure you feel at home and that you have some clear direction.

On your first day, you'll have a one-on-one meeting with your immediate supervisor. This will give you a chance to ask questions, and give us a feel for how you work and ideas for a good project to get you started on. Example question: 

- Based on my skillset, are there team member(s) I should sync up with to get involved in a project?

Communication is the key to everything, and setting clear expectations early on is the best way to start any relationship. We'll make sure you know where to go to resolve issues and ask questions. When in doubt, reach out to your supervisor. 

Here are some of the basics:

- HR, paperwork, benefits
	- The first point of contact on our team is Valeria Mendoza - valeria.mendoza@fusion.net. 
	- You’ll have conversations with HR representatives from Univision, as well.
- Equipment and software
- Again, Valeria Mendoza is a good first point of contact here. 
- Univision ETS will issue your computer and get you set up with proper admin access, and help you troubleshoot issues with your hardware. ETS can be reached at 855-886-4357.
- Work related (what should I be working on, I noticed a bug, etc.)
	- Use public communication channels unless the discussion topic explicitly needs to be private. If you need a private conversation, Direct Messages in Slack or email works well.
	- The #tech channel in Slack is always a good place to start a conversation. You can ping your supervisor or another team member by typing `@<username>` or ping the entire channel with `@channel`.
	- Want to feel more Fusion-y? Set your Slack sidebar theme to `#2A0337,#2A0337,#2DDBB6,#FFFFFF,#4A4664,#FFFFFF,#22E5A1,#D74577`

 
## Your first week

We realize that during the first week you will be spending a lot of time setting up your equipment, getting familiar with our tools and processes, etc. While we won't expect a high level of production, we believe that jumping in with both feet is the best way to get started. We’d love to have every new hire get a commit to production on their first day. This is all about breaking the ice, boosting your self-confidence, and getting you involved with the team as early as possible.

We'll work with you to identify a project that is well defined, suited to your abilities, and scoped to a manageable time frame. We want you to have fun and be successful with your first project. Be sure to ask questions and communicate if you're feeling confused or in over your head. Everybody on the team has been where you are at some point, and we're happy to help each other out.

As a new hire you’ll write an intro post that’s published on fusion.net in the Tech Product section. It’s a great opportunity to introduce yourself to the company as a whole and let the world know that you work for Fusion. Your supervisor will work with you through composing, editing, and shipping your intro post. You’ll probably be surprised at how good it feels when it goes live and you can show off to your family and friends.

## Your first month

Your paperwork is in order, your equipment is set up just the way you like it, you've gotten some work under your belt, and ideally you've shipped at least a few pull requests (PRs).

### Facetime

Whether it’s a trip to the NYC or Florida offices or a conference, we’d like everyone to have the opportunity to meet and socialize with team members face to face within the first month.

We believe strongly in our [distributed team structure](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/04/08/the-remote-manifesto/) and our [commitment to communication](https://github.com/fusioneng/tech-docs/blob/master/team-culture/communication.md). Still, it’s difficult to get to know people from avatars, text conversations, and the occasional video chat. Meeting the people you work with face to face is a crucial step in truly feeling like a member of the team. 

### OKRs

We use [BetterWorks](https://github.com/fusioneng/tech-docs/blob/master/tools/betterworks.md) to track "Objectives and Key Results" (OKRs). Your supervisor will help you understand how this works, and you will be expected to have your OKRs defined within your first month.
