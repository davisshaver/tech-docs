# Slack

We use [Slack](https://slack.com/) at Fusion for our _synchronous_, realtime backchannel. Slack mitigates the need for email and facilitates quick exchanges of information between groups and individuals. It also acts as a unifying layer for alerts and updates from all kinds of third-party systems, like Trello, Github, Travis CI, and many more. It's the yang to [O2's yin](o2.md).

Our rooms include:

* [#edit-tech](https://fusionnetwork.slack.com/messages/edit-tech/) - Where editorial can ask questions of technology and vice versa.
* [#growth-hackers](https://fusionnetwork.slack.com/messages/growth-hackers/) - The technology behind audience development.
