# Tools

These are the tools behind [how we communicate](../team-culture/communication.md).

* [Betterworks](betterworks.md) - Captures the OKRs, or Objectives and Key Results, for our entire company.
* [Github](github.md) - Github issues are where the development work is defined and acted upon. An issue generally goes from backlog -> prioritized -> in-development -> QA, and can comprise multiple pull requests.
* [O2](o2.md) - A living reference site, designed to allow for asynchronous conversation and collaboration. Think of it as an email alternative.
* [Slack](slack.md) - Our synchronous backchannel, for quick, realtime conversation. Think of it as a meetings alternative.
* [Software](software.md) - Desktop applications the team uses â€” and inspiration for what you should try out next.
* [Trello](trello.md) - Captures the lifecycle of our projects. Each project is represented by a card, which ideally is written in PRD format.
