# Betterworks

[Betterworks](http://www.betterworks.com/) is a web-based tool we use to keep track of our "Objectives and Key Results" (OKRs).

If OKRs / Betterworks comes off a bit corporate, give it 30 minutes. When working within a large organization, OKRs are helpful in a few primary ways:

1. Taking the time to concisely write your goals as a few Objectives, each with a few Key Results, helps each person clarify what's most important for them to work on.
1. Because everyone at Fusion uses Betterworks, it's much easier to access the company's priorities, and see how everyone's priorities trickle down from them.
1. Because everyone has written their goals in a common format, concise OKRs, it's much easier to understand these priorities.

But wait, what exactly are OKRs?

The Objective is what you want to accomplish — the aspirational goal. Each Objective has a few Key Results, which represent concrete steps to achieve the goal.

Here's an example:

> **Objective:** Foster the technology team’s ability to be an enabler of the company’s product ambitions
>
> **Key Results:**
> - Solicit hack day themes from other departments in the company.
> - Include one non-tech team member on each Hack Day team for our three remaining hack days in Q2.
> - Identify and onboard five additional non-technology team members to our Trello and Github product workflow
