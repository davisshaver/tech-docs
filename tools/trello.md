# Trello

Within the Product department, we use [Trello](https://trello.com/) to keep track of projects and their status.

Our boards align with our teams:

* [Editorial](https://trello.com/b/sUHD6JBM/editorial-team)
* [Experiments](https://trello.com/b/Ec4YVyDY/ux-experiments)
* [Glance](https://trello.com/b/vpFFzXRe/aud-dev-glance-team)
* [Platform](https://trello.com/b/jaeVZVAE/platform-team)
* [R&D](https://trello.com/b/PbWUh6ua/tech-r-d)

An ideal Trello card is written in [PRD format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_requirements_document). However, we encourage everyone to use only as much definition as they need. Often, cards are of varying length depending on how well the project needs to be documented.

Each board typically has stacks similar to this workflow:

1. **Inbox** - Inbound project, which needs to be clarified and vetted.
1. **Backlog** - The project is established as a reasonable idea, but hasn't been committed to being implemented.
1. **Product Definition** - The project is ready for requirements and design, as necessary. Technical requirements are evaluated during the product definition stage.
1. **Up Next** - The project is ready for development, when development resources are available.
1. **In-Development** - Execution of the project is in-progress.
1. **Shipped - <date>** - Project is shipped
